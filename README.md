## pixl - Laravel Web Based MVC image hosting coursework
For this project we have been tasked with completing a full stack Laravel Web application, to be hosted on an already setup Apache server deployed on Amazon Web Service (AWS). The topic of the project is to create an Ultra Simple Content Management System (USCMS), which is described as featuring full authenticated and authorized create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality for the connected database, the ability to manage file uploading and handling, and the capability of serving uploaded files in HTTP responses.

To complete this project, I have decided to go with an image hosting platform similar to “imgur” – which consequently is no longer available in the UK. The reason for this idea is that it fully fits within the Laravel Eloquent Object Relational Mapping (ORM) system which is required for the project, as well as containing authorization and authentication for having logins and admins who will be able to monitor projects, but also standard users who aren’t logged in who will still be able to view images but not comment. Although this may seem quite a straight forward project, additional features can be added to build more complex functionality - such as commenting, replying to comments, saving favourites, like and dislike feedback, profile pages.
